TASK

As a system engineer your expertise is asked to create a firewall ruleset for a hosting server.
The server is provided with the following services: Apache, ProFTPd and bind9. Please, do not allow zonetransfers (think twice). Also protect the server against ping flooding. The server is not allowed to make outgoing connections, except for the installation of security updates.

After the setup of the server following iptables rules need to be added.

1) Do not allow zonetransfer:

$ sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf

Add following rule to zone to block zonetranfers:

allow-transfer {none;};

Ex. of /etc/bind/named.conf file:
------------------------------------------
| zone "test-lh" {                       |
|         type master;                   |
|         file "/etc/bind/test-lh";      |
|         allow-transfer {none;};        |
| };                                     |
------------------------------------------

$ sudo systemctl restart bind9
$ /etc/init.d/named restart

Test with dig command:

The dig command is used as follows:

dig [server] [name] [type]
[server] – The hostname or IP address the query is directed to
[name] – The DNS (Domain Name Server) of the server to query
[type] – The type of DNS record to retrieve. By default (or if left blank), dig uses the A record type

Ex. of dig command:

$ dig @10.0.2.10 test-lh axfr

The output of command must contain:
; Transfer failed.


2) To prevent ping flooding:

$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT --match limit --limit 5/minute
$ sudo iptables  -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
$ sudo iptables  -A OUTPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply -j ACCEPT


3) Block all outgoing connections except for the installation of security updates:

$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d security.debian.org --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
